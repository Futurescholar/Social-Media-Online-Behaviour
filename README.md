## Title:
Social Media Entertainment & Online Behavior Analysis

---
## Objective:
To analyze user behavior patterns across social media, entertainment, and digital platforms — assessing screen time, platform preferences, and the impact of device type, sleep quality, and digital well-being awareness on content consumption.

---
## KEY QUESTIONS 
- User Behavior and Preferences
   - What is the correlation between daily screen time and social media fatigue levels?
   - Which social media platform is most commonly used as the primary platform across different age groups?
- Demographics and Digital Usage
   - How does internet speed (Mbps) vary by country, and does it influence time spent on online activities like video content, gaming, or messaging?
   - What is the relationship between monthly income and the number of subscription platforms a user subscribes to?
- Time Management and Productivity
   - How does time spent on work/study compare with time spent on entertainment activities across different age groups or marital statuses?
   - Are users with higher physical activity time also reporting better sleep quality?
- Engagement with Content and Platforms
   - What type of preferred content (educational, entertaining) leads to higher daily social media time?
   - How does the number of notifications received daily affect social media fatigue levels or time spent on digital platforms?
- Tech Savviness and Device Usage
   - What devices are preferred by users with high tech-savviness levels for consuming entertainment content?
   - Is there a significant difference in digital well-being awareness between users who spend more time on educational platforms versus entertainment platforms?

## Tools Used
Power BI (for Data Cleaning, DAX Calculations, and Visualization)

---
## Visualization Approach
- Imported data into Power BI and cleaned using Power Query Editor.
- Created centralized DAX measures to calculate averages and counts.
- Designed KPI Cards for:
   - Average Screen Time: 6.99 hrs/day
   - Users Covered: 300K
   - Countries Covered: 6
   - Avg Monthly Entertainment Spend: $249.67
   - Avg Daily Notifications: 104.59
   - Avg Work/Study Time: 5.01 hrs/day
- Built visualizations:
  - Stacked bar chart for platform usage by age group.
  - Scatter plots for:
     - Monthly Income vs. Subscription Count
     - Screen Time vs. Fatigue
  - Line & Bar Charts for:
     - Time spent on Gaming, Messaging, Video (by Country & Internet Speed)
     - Entertainment vs. Work/Study by Age
     - Physical Activity vs. Sleep Quality
  - Pie Chart for Tech-Savvy Users by Device
  - Bar Chart for Content Type Preferences
- Added filters for: Social Media Platform, Content Type, Device Type, Country, Gender, Age Group, and Digital Well-being Awareness

## Key Observations
- Content Trends by Age: Gen Z and Millennials dominate TikTok and Instagram usage, while Gen X prefers Facebook.
- Income vs Subscription: Weak correlation — subscription counts do not vary significantly with income.
- Screen Time & Fatigue: Higher daily screen time aligns with increased self-reported fatigue.
- Device Usage: PC, Smartphone, and Tablet usage is nearly even among tech-savvy users.
- Entertainment vs Work/Study: Users in younger demographics (Gen Z, Millennials) spend more time on entertainment than older groups.
- Content Preferences: Short videos and series lead in average social media engagement time.
- Sleep & Physical Activity: Higher sleep quality correlates slightly with more physical activity.
- Digital Awareness Impact: Users with higher digital well-being awareness spend more time on educational platforms and less on entertainment.

---
## Summary of Findings
- Engagement Time is consistently high across entertainment and messaging platforms.
- Digital literacy appears to influence time spent productively (education vs. entertainment).
- High screen time can be linked to fatigue and sedentary behavior (low physical activity).
- Device preference is balanced, showing flexibility in how users access content.
- Geographic and speed-based consumption patterns indicate that faster internet drives more engagement.

---
## Recommendations
- Boost Digital Well-being:
   - Incorporate awareness programs to balance entertainment with educational content.
   - Add reminders or prompts for breaks after long screen sessions.
- Optimize Content Strategies:
   - Invest more in short-form and serial content to align with user preferences.
   - Gamify educational content for younger audiences to increase educational platform engagement.
- Platform-Specific Targeting:
   - Create segmented campaigns for Gen Z (TikTok, Instagram) and Gen X (Facebook).
   - Offer tailored subscription plans with value-added features for high-fatigue users.
- Physical Activity Integration:
   - Encourage light physical exercises or wellness tips in entertainment apps.
   - Partner with fitness platforms for cross-promotion.
-  Tech Accessibility Enhancements:
   - Maintain equal compatibility across PC, smartphones, and tablets for inclusive content delivery.
